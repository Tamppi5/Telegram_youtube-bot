## Bot token

You need to create a file called **bot_token.txt** which contains your bot_token and place it in the root directory for the code to work. The token is given to you by the BotFather -bot in Telegram.

The **bot_token.txt** -file should never be pushed into the repository for safety reasons. Our .gitignore -file should prevent this from happening.
