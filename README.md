## Telegram bot to query Youtube

You can send the bot a search word in natural langauge. The bot will respond with the first video that it finds on youtube for the search word.

One can find the bot and youtube search algorithm from src/main/scala/s1/telegrambots/YT_bot

## Bot token

You need to create a file called **bot_token.txt** which contains your bot_token and place it in the root directory for the code to work. The token is given to you by the BotFather -bot in Telegram.

The **bot_token.txt** -file should never be pushed into the repository for safety reasons.
